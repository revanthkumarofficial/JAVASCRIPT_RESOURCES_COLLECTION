// JavaScript is a dynamic language or loosely typed therefore a variable doesnâ€™t associate with any type

// In other words, the same variable can hold values of different types at any time.



let counter = 120; // counter is a number
counter = false;   // counter is now a boolean
counter = "foo";   // counter is now a string
